        <h2>My First Travel</h2>
        <p>Travelling makes me happy, it gives me peace. Travelling is an amazing way to learn a lot of things in life.
            A lot of people around the world travel every year to
            many places. Moreover, it is important to travel to humans. Some travel to learn more while some travel to
            take a break
            from their life. No matter the reason, travelling opens a big door for us to explore the world beyond our
            imagination
            and indulge in many things. </p>
